    title: "Herbalism",
    blurb:
      "As an Intuitive Herbalist I treat a full spectrum of chronic and acute illnesses and conditions. I take into account western medical diagnostics, pathology, scans etc, to evaluate. Herbs are a safe and non toxic treatment, often used to offset side effects from medications. Over the years I have had referrals from specialist and like minded GP's working together for the best patient outcome. I am a drop dose practitioner in general, using non ethanol liquids, and all of the dry herbs, powders and capsules are organic.",

    title: "Clairvoyant",
    blurb:
      "Clairvoyant / Medium would be the best description for the work. A reading is the term for a session with a client. My story of how this came about is beyond the space available here. I would like to thank the late Margaret Dent and Jody for their faith in me and my abilities, when i had none. To SJW my deepest thanks for your encouragement. In 1995 I sought professional help for anxiety attacks and via hypnosis I had an experience that would change my life and my perception of life. 7 years later I charged a fee and 16 years on I am still in the work.",

    title: "Counselling",
    blurb:
      "Life is full of challenges. At times Traumatic , Depressing , Anxiety filled and Overwhelming. We have addictions of all kinds. Then there are those people who are not aware they are suffering from anxiety or depression. In my mind reaching out for help requires courage and vulnerability. Counselling is the first step, a non judgemental, safe haven to find your own path. Here in our own purpose built studio in Coffs Harbour it is relaxing and peaceful. I also work in Camden for those Sydney clients unable to come North.",

    title: "Hypnotherapy",
    blurb:
      "Hypnosis is a method of inducing a natural state of consciousness.Contrary to popular belief it involves focused attention. In this relaxed state of mind the subconscious remains receptive to positive suggestions that help create new behaviours that are beneficial to the client. Hypnotherapy is one method of bringing lasting changes to long held negative behaviours. I have used it to treat anxiety disorders, addictions, poor self esteem, depression caused by life events, sport performance and all kinds of phobias.",
